# Folder-Backup-Software
Software that allow user to backup multiples times a specified folder.

I thought it would be useful for me to do this software, but in the end I don't use it that much. So I share it for everyone, you can edit everything you want.
I do not pretend to be a good developer so there can be some mistakes, but it works :)

It will ask you for a directory and a name. Then it will create a folder (named as you precised) in the directory where the jar (or the executable) is located, with a config.yml. So make sure the file is in a specific directory ! *(or if you don't want to, it's okay you can of course)*
If you want to change directory, you can just delete 'config.yml' or directly edit the line corresponding to the path in the configuration file (you should also change the name too), and that's it!
