# Folder-Backup-Software
Software that allow user to backup multiples times a specified folder.

I thought it would be useful for me to do this software, but in the end I don't use it that much. So I share it for everyone, you can edit everything you want. 
I do not pretend to be a good developer so there can be some mistakes, but it works :)

I wrote this in Eclipse 2022-03 with Java 1.8.

It will ask you for a directory and a name. Then it will create a folder (named as you precised) in the directory where the '.jar' is, with a config.yml. So make sure the file is in a specific directory ! (or if you don't want to, it's okay you can of course)
If you want to change directory, you can juste deletes 'config.yml', or directly changes the values in the file, it should not be hard as there are only two lines.
